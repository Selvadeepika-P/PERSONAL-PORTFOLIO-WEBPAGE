This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase a developer’s skills, projects, and contact information. The website is structured using HTML for content and CSS for styling and layout. It 
features a clean and modern design with a responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across different screen sizes. The homepage includes a navigation bar with links to key sections such as Home, About, Projects, 
and Contact.The "About" section provides a brief introduction to the developer and their current internship at CodTech, while the "Projects" section highlights two sample projects: a JavaScript-based quiz 
application and a real-time chat application using WebSockets and React. The "Contact" section includes the developer’s email and LinkedIn profile, making it easy for potential recruiters or collaborators to 
reach out.The CSS styles enhance the visual appeal with centered content, a neutral background, and smooth layout transitions for smaller devices. This portfolio is ideal for students or early-career developers 
who want to professionally present their work and experience online.
